## github lab

1. Make a repository - private!
	+ YES initialize with a README
	+ NO do not need a LICENSE
	+ NO do not need a .gitignore
2. **Clone** repository into a new RStudio cloud project via terminal
3. **Create** a new Rmd file from the template, and make a plot of your choosing. 
4. **Add** the file
	+ Run **status**
5. **Commit** the changes
6. **Push** the changes
	+ Return to github website and see its there
7. Within github itself, modify the README to explain the contents of the repository. Commit these changes - they are already pushed!
8. Return to cloud and **pull**
9. Run **log** to see your history
10. Practice troubleshooting. We will create a bad scenario and do the EASY QUICK solution!!
	+ Muck with a file and delete the plot, but don't add or commit
	+ Then run **diff**
	+ Then run **checkout**
11. Then update your code and add, commit, push.
12. Return to the github website and examine your commit history

---------------------------------

1. Fork my repository
2. Go to cloud and "new project from REPO"
3. Make the necessary changes to get started:
	+ **mkdir**
	+ **git mv** the R and Rmd files
	+ Make literally any change, add, commit, push.
4. Be mindful to **NEVER** CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT FOR WHAT IS IN YOUR FOLDER!!!!!!!
